import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-list-view-table" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-list-view-table/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-list-view-table` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-list-view-table/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-list-view-table/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

The `ListViewTable` component brings advanced table functionality inspired by the List View found in macOS Finder. Building on the core features of the [Mantine Table component](https://mantine.dev/core/table/), it offers a familiar and intuitive interface for displaying lists of items in a structured, table-like format. Notably, it allows users to **reorder columns** and **resize** them dynamically, giving greater flexibility and control over data presentation. This makes it an excellent choice for applications that require a modern, customizable list view with enhanced interactivity.

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

## Column Width Constraints

You can control column widths using `width`, `minWidth`, and `maxWidth` properties. The component automatically adjusts initial widths to respect these constraints and prevents resizing beyond the specified limits.

### Minimum Width

Use `minWidth` to ensure columns don't become too narrow. When the initial `width` is smaller than `minWidth`, the component automatically adjusts to the minimum value.

<Demo data={demos.minWidth} />

### Maximum Width

Use `maxWidth` to prevent columns from becoming too wide. When the initial `width` is larger than `maxWidth`, the component automatically adjusts to the maximum value.

<Demo data={demos.maxWidth} />

### Both Minimum and Maximum Width

You can combine `minWidth` and `maxWidth` to create precise width constraints. The component will adjust initial widths to fit within these bounds and restrict resizing to the specified range.

<Demo data={demos.minAndMaxWidth} />

## Column Width Behavior

The `ListViewTable` component provides flexible column width management that adapts to different scenarios. Understanding how width calculation works will help you create the optimal layout for your data.

### Auto Width vs Fixed Width

When no `width` is specified for a column, it automatically adjusts to the content and available space. When a `width` is specified, the column maintains that exact width. You can mix both approaches within the same table.

<Demo data={demos.widthConstraintsWithoutResizing} />

### Mixed Width Scenarios

You can combine auto-width and fixed-width columns in the same table. This is particularly useful when you have some columns that need consistent sizing (like actions or status) and others that should adapt to content (like names or descriptions).

<Demo data={demos.mixedWidthConstraints} />

## Horizontal Scrolling with Table.ScrollContainer

When your table content is wider than the available container width, you can use Mantine's [`Table.ScrollContainer`](https://mantine.dev/core/table/#scroll-container) component to enable smooth horizontal scrolling. This is especially useful for tables with many columns or when you need to maintain fixed column widths.

### Basic Horizontal Scrolling

Wrap your `ListViewTable` with `Table.ScrollContainer` and set a `minWidth` to enable horizontal scrolling when the content exceeds the container width. All columns will scroll together horizontally.

<Demo data={demos.scrollContainer} />

### Horizontal Scrolling with Sticky Columns

You can combine horizontal scrolling with sticky columns to keep important identifier columns (like names or IDs) visible while other columns scroll horizontally. Set `sticky: true` on the columns you want to remain fixed.

<Demo data={demos.scrollContainerWithSticky} />

## Scroll Area Integration

The `ListViewTable` works seamlessly with Mantine's `ScrollArea` component. This is useful when you want to create a fixed-height table with scrollable content while maintaining the table's sticky header functionality.

When used inside a `ScrollArea`, the `stickyHeader` prop will make the table header stick to the top of the scroll area, providing a consistent user experience during scrolling.

<Demo data={demos.scrollArea} />

## Advanced Features

The `ListViewTable` component provides internal implementations for sorting, column reordering, and column resizing by default. However, developers can take full control over these features when needed for custom business logic or integration with external state management.

### External Sorting Control

By default, the component handles sorting internally when you click on sortable column headers. However, you can override this behavior to implement custom sorting logic, integrate with external APIs, or manage sorting state in your application's state management system.

When you provide both `sortStatus` and `onSort` props, the component will use external sorting mode. You'll need to handle the data sorting logic yourself and update the `sortStatus` when the user clicks on column headers.

<Demo data={demos.externalSorting} />

### External Column Reordering and Resizing

Similarly, column reordering and resizing are handled internally by default. You can override these behaviors by providing `onColumnReorder` and `onColumnResize` callbacks. This is useful when you need to persist column configurations, sync with external state, or implement custom reordering logic.

The component will still provide the visual feedback and drag-and-drop functionality, but you'll have full control over how the state changes are handled.

<Demo data={demos.externalReorderingAndResizing} />

## Sticky Header

The `stickyHeader` prop enables the table header to remain fixed at the top of the viewport (or scroll container) when the user scrolls through the table content. This is particularly useful for long tables where you want to keep the column headers visible at all times.

The sticky header feature works both with the document scroll and when the table is used inside a `ScrollArea`. When enabled, the header will maintain its position and remain accessible during scrolling, improving the user experience by providing constant context about the data structure.

You can also use the `stickyHeaderOffset` prop to adjust the sticky header position when your page has a fixed navigation bar or header. This ensures the table header doesn't overlap with other fixed elements on the page.

<Demo data={demos.stickyHeader} />

## Table States

The `ListViewTable` component provides built-in support for common table states to enhance user experience during data loading and when no data is available.

### Loading State

When data is being fetched or processed, you can show a loading indicator by setting the `loading` prop to `true`. This displays a spinner overlay while maintaining the table structure and headers.

<Demo data={demos.loadingState} />

### Custom Loading Props

You can customize the default Mantine `Loader` component by providing custom props through the `loadingProps` prop. This allows you to change the loader's size, color, and other properties without replacing the entire loading component.

<Demo data={demos.customLoadingProps} />

### Custom Loading Component

For more advanced customization, you can provide a completely custom loading component using the `loadingComponent` prop. This prop accepts either a React element or a component function:

- **React Element**: A pre-configured JSX element that will be rendered as-is
- **Component Function**: A component that will receive `loadingProps` as props, allowing for dynamic customization

<Demo data={demos.customLoadingElement} />

You can also pass a component function that will receive the `loadingProps`:

<Demo data={demos.customLoadingComponent} />

### Empty State

When no data is available to display, you can customize the empty state using the `emptyText` prop. This prop accepts either a simple text string or a React component, giving you full flexibility to create rich, interactive empty states that provide better user experience and guidance.

#### Default Empty State

If you don't specify the `emptyText` prop, the table will show the default message: **"No data available"**.

<Demo data={demos.defaultEmptyState} />

#### Simple Text Empty State

You can provide a custom text message by passing a string to the `emptyText` prop:

<Demo data={demos.simpleEmptyText} />

#### Inline JSX Empty State

For slightly more visual appeal, you can pass inline JSX elements:

<Demo data={demos.inlineJsxEmptyState} />

#### Advanced Custom Component Empty State

For more sophisticated empty states, you can pass a React component that includes icons, custom styling, descriptions, and interactive elements like buttons:

<Demo data={demos.customEmptyState} />

## Vertical Variant

The `ListViewTable` component supports the `variant="vertical"` prop from [Mantine Table component](https://mantine.dev/core/table/), which displays data in a key-value format where each row represents a property-value pair. This is particularly useful for displaying detailed information about a single item, such as configuration settings, user profiles, or metadata.

When using the vertical variant, consider setting `layout="fixed"` to ensure consistent column widths and a more structured appearance.

<Demo data={demos.verticalVariant} />
